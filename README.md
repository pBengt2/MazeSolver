# Maze Generator and Maze Solver

This project was made for cs211. The assignment was to create a maze solver using BFS or DFS, and linkedLists. I expanded this by coding my own maze generator (for more complex input), and using a faster search.

## How to Run

The generator file is as simple as compiling and running. The maxSize and minSize can be adjusted as desired. 

The solver reads the maze from a .txt file, which it takes the filename of as a command line argument (as well as an optional '-d' command for debugging).
